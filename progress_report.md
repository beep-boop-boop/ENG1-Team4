As outlined in the [section 4](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1roN6e_wGoE9feEn86q4YeshbR44R-lyU?usp=sharing) deliverable, this was our initial plan for tackling the project. A rough idea of it was developed immediately after the team got together and read the task brief.

Below, we will provide a version of the plan we ended up with for every week of the autumn and spring terms. 
On each chart, the gray vertical line represents the date the snapshot was taken on, and the blue shaded area represents the Christmas holiday period.
The closeness to completion for each task is represented by its shading in green.
