As outlined in the [section 4](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1roN6e_wGoE9feEn86q4YeshbR44R-lyU?usp=sharing) deliverable, this was our initial plan for tackling the project. A rough idea of it was developed immediately after the team got together and read the task brief.

Below, we will provide a version of the plan we ended up with for every week of the autumn and spring terms. 
On each chart, the gray vertical line represents the date the snapshot was taken on, and the blue shaded area represents the Christmas holiday period.
The closeness to completion for each task is represented by its shading in green.

* Week 1 (Aut/9)
  * During the first week, the team made significant progress on picking the design direction of the game. Alex also started working on initialising the Java workspace for the project and adapting the tileset we sourced. The plan for the rest of the project is provided below:
  * ![plan week 1](/ENG1-Team4/docs/assets/gantt_w1.png)
* Week 2 (Aut/10)
  * During the second week, we continued working on the map to ensure we have a strong foundation for the rest of the project to build on. We also fully settled on our product requirements and made progress on some of the documentation deliverables. The plan for the rest of the project is provided below:
  * ![plan week 2](/ENG1-Team4/docs/assets/gantt_w2.png)
* Week 3 (Spr/1)
  * With the progress we made over the holidays, most of the work planned for sprint 1 has been finished before its scheduled time began. Therefore, the team decided to shift the implementation of game entities to sprint 2 instead, leaving more time for debugging at the end fo the project. During week 3, the team made progress on the Projectile, College and PlayerShip classes. The plan for the following weeks is provided below:
  * ![plan week 3](/ENG1-Team4/docs/assets/gantt_w3.png)
* Week 4 (Spr/2)
  * During week 4, the team was focused on implementing the Coin class as well as polishing the collision system. The College, PlayerShip and Projectile class have been completely finalised, with the Coin class still requiring some time to fully get right. Its implementation has therefore been shifted over to sprint 3, with the GUI and collision system being finished earlier than expected. The plan for the following weeks is provided below:
  * ![plan week 4](/ENG1-Team4/docs/assets/gantt_w4.png)
* Week 5 (Spr/3)
  * During week 5, the team has finally completed the Coin implementation with efforts from all of the team. The documentation as well as the code is now proofread and ready to submit, with minor work remaining on the website's visuals. There are no major tasks left for the final week, with the Gantt chart for the remaining week being presented below.
  * ![plan week 5](/ENG1-Team4/docs/assets/gantt_w5.png)
* Week 6 (Spr/4)
  This week, the team has finished building the JAR file, fixing small visual bugs and preparing the submission ZIP. All of the tasks are now complete and the team is ready for the second phase of the assesment.
